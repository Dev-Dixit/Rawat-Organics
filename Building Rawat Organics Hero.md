# 🌿 Rawat Organics Landing Page – Development Workflow

## 🎯 Objective
Build a premium, high-performance landing page for Rawat Organics using React (Vite), Tailwind CSS, and modern animation libraries.

The UI must follow the Stitch design exactly but be implemented using reusable, scalable component architecture.

---

## 🧩 Tech Stack

- React (Vite)
- Tailwind CSS
- Framer Motion (UI animations)
- GSAP + ScrollTrigger (scroll-based video animation)
- Lucide React (icons)
- Zustand (state management if needed)

---

## ⚠️ Development Rules

- Do NOT build the entire UI at once
- Build step-by-step in a modular way
- Focus on reusability and clean architecture
- Follow performance-first approach

---

# 🎨 STEP 1: Global Styles & Theme

## Create global CSS variables in :root

Define a nature-inspired color palette:

- Primary Green (brand)
- Secondary Green (light)
- Earth Brown
- Background Beige / Off-white
- Dark Text Color
- Muted Text Color

### Requirements:
- Use CSS variables in :root
- Maintain consistent spacing scale
- Define font family (Inter or Manrope)

---

# 🧱 STEP 2: Layout Structure

Create reusable layout components:

## Required:
- Container (max-width + padding)
- Section Wrapper
- Layout (Navbar placeholder + main wrapper)

### Rules:
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Clean spacing system
- Avoid hardcoded widths

---

# 🎬 STEP 3: Hero Section (IMPORTANT)

## Goal:
Build a premium hero section with:

- Heading
- Subheading
- CTA Button
- Background video / canvas animation

---

## 🎥 Video Scroll Animation (GSAP)

Implement frame-by-frame scroll animation using:

- GSAP
- ScrollTrigger
- Canvas API

### Behavior:
- Convert video into image sequence (frames)
- Render frames on canvas
- On scroll → update frames
- Smooth scrubbing effect

---

## Animation Rules:

- Use GSAP ONLY for scroll-based animation
- Use Framer Motion for UI elements (text fade, buttons)
- Keep animations smooth and subtle

---

## ⚡ Performance Rules:

- Limit frames (max ~100)
- Use optimized images (WebP)
- Lazy load frames if possible
- Ensure smooth performance on desktop
- Provide fallback for mobile (static image or simple video)

---

## 🧩 Component Structure

Hero must be split into:

- HeroSection
- HeroContent
- HeroCanvas (GSAP logic)

---

## ❌ Avoid:

- Large single component
- Inline styles
- Heavy unoptimized assets
- Over-animation

---

## ✅ Deliverables (for now):

1. Global CSS (:root variables)
2. Layout components
3. Hero Section with:
   - Framer Motion animations (text/buttons)
   - GSAP scroll-based frame animation

---

## 🚫 DO NOT:

- Do not build other sections yet
- Do not implement full landing page
- Do not skip component structure

---

## 🎯 End Goal (Current Phase)

Deliver a clean, reusable, animated Hero section with proper layout and theme setup, ready to scale into a full landing page.

### Planner Response

Excellent! I now have everything I need. Let me create the implementation plan and then build the Header + Hero section. Given the comprehensive context, I'll proceed directly with building since the requirements are very clear.

### Planner Response

I've successfully set up the foundational design system and completed the layout, Header, and Hero section components according to the Stitch design references!

All the implementations have been verified by running the `tsc + vite build` pipeline perfectly. You can review the details of the implementation in the **Walkthrough artifact** I've created for you.

To verify and test everything interactively:
1. Open a terminal in `RawatWeb/client`
2. Run `npm run dev`
3. Check out the transparent-to-frosted glass Navbar transition, and the Hero layout with its Framer Motion text animations and the GSAP scroll-pinned canvas layout. 

Let me know if you would like me to adjust any of the animations or typography before we move on to building the **About / Story Sections** and **Product Categories**!
